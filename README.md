This is the repository for my personal website.
It is a simple static website without any backend.

## Requirements
You will need [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) installed to build this website.

It can be hosted using any standard web server. Jekyll projects can also be hosted using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) which makes deployment simple.

## Build
You can build the website by running`jekyll build`

The generated website should be in the _site directory.

## Run
You can run a local server by running `jekyll serve`
