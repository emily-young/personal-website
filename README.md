# Personal website

This is the code for my personal website.

It uses [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to generate static HTML + CSS, so it can be hosted using any standard web
server. Jekyll projects can also be hosted
using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) which makes deployment simple.

## Dependencies

This website is built using Bundler which can be installed using `gem install bundler`

Then install the required dependencies by running `bundle install`

## Build

To build the website run `bundle exec jekyll build`

The generated website files should be in the _site directory.

## Run

To start a local server run `bundle exec jekyll serve`
